 desc_feudalism:0 "Over time, most societies develop a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. After the fall of the Roman Empire this need came to be filled by a number of institutions and customs that, taken together, are often considered to be part of the European Feudal system. For similar reasons, permanent governments and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that reach back farther than Feudalism itself.\nUnlike the other institutions, 'Feudalism' covers a wide range of different systems and exists in 1444 in all parts of the world where a strong tradition of urbanism, institutionalized government and social stratification has reached a critical point. The institution can spread from contact with any of these cultures, or in some cases begin to grow on its own in a society that fulfills certain criteria."
 desc_renaissance:0 "Since the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the Italian city states have been patronizing artists and scholars exploring the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. The cultural movement called the Renaissance has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy, and music. Its scholars, the humanists, are experts on everything from politics, to the arts, textual analysis, and architecture, analyzing the society in which they live and comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. A new ideal for rulers as well as subjects is spreading as quickly as the early printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 desc_new_world_i:0 "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has also led to a realization of the vastness of the globe and an improvement in navigational techniques . As animals, crops, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic, the first steps were taken toward a truly global economy. With foreign lands and people being mapped and documented, ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate are increasingly being colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds call into question what was once considered fact, and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri, the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 desc_ei_empiricism:0 "In the 1540s, a remarkable treatise on the nature of the universe titled 'On the revolution of the Celestial Spheres' offered new evidence that the earth revolves around the sun, and not the other way around. While this was not a new idea, the method by which the astronomer proved his conclusion was. He claimed that all knowledge should be based on rigorous testing of theory against the observed reality. Once this principle dubbed 'Empiricism' caught on, it changed the very idea of what science is. Scholars hotly debated the merits of this method and proposed amendments and counterpoints. While a consensus on experiments is still far in the future, this marks the beginning of the establishment of the scientific method."
 desc_ei_standing_armies:0 "For most of the medieval period, levy armies, militias and mercenaries have been the predominant way of organizing armies. At the beginning of the modern era, things have started to shift. During the Italian wars of the late 15th and early 16th century, condottieri and other mercenaries were still the most prominent forces, but even those are starting to lose their luster, as did levies before them. In this new era of centralized states and fledgling empires, the need for a professional and permanent military emerged:0 The concept of 'Standing Armies' was established and the professionalization of state militaries started to spread across the world. Permanently salaried soldiers, academies for officers and the steady competition for the newest innovation in war would swiftly follow. This was truly the beginning of a new era of warfare."
 desc_printing_press:0 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Mainzian Goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg and Venetian Printer Aldus Manutius, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures. \n\nNow that printing has spread throughout Europe, thousands of copies of anything from religious and political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing ever more commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technology as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 desc_global_trade:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes, and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, at the beginning of the 17th century all trade is increasingly becoming part of a greater, worldwide network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa, and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being expanded into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants, and others are making a fortune distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly global economy, but the first seeds have surely been sown."
 desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries have increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent, the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that inhibit mass production as well as pioneer ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than with expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change from the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 desc_ei_rationalism:0 "With the advent of Empiricism and the challenge it poses to classical philosophy, the emergence of a counter-movement inspired by classical philosophy seemed inevitable. 'Rationalism' represents a branch of philosophy that is concerned with logic, reasoning, and the generation of knowledge through reason alone. While most of the philosophers that follow this new way of thinking do not dismiss Empiricism as false, they do consider it an inferior way of creating knowledge. \nFrom the beginning, the logical and rigorous principle of Rationalism made an important contribution to the development of the scientific method. In time, and through a grand synthesis with other revolutionary ideas, Rationalism would become a cornerstone of the scientific revolution taking place in the 17th and 18th century."
 desc_ei_central_banks:0 "The history of banking reaches far into antiquity and has experienced many developments. Advancements in bookkeeping, credits, insurance and the establishment of stock markets have made it easier to transfer and invest money safely. Throughout the medieval and early modern period, the role of the state in this was defined as a borrower. Even the most powerful states, or more often the heads of state, were indebted to private banks. But due to their power to avoid foreclosure, monarchs often defaulted, making the financial system rather unstable. \n\nWith the establishment of a central bank, governments intended to change all of this. Having merged multiple important banking houses and placing them directly under state control, the government hoped to achieve a greater control of the monetary system and secure access to capital markets. While the primary goal was to reliably take out and repay loans, bankers of the 17th century were already thinking about the future of monetary policy."
 desc_enlightenment:0 "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever-increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications and coffee houses, kings, scientists, philosophers and littérateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of the ideals of the Enlightenment to all of humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs, expeditions are being sent to measure, catalog, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the natural laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the rights of man.\n\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The light of reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."
 desc_weights_and_measures:0 "The bureau of weights and measures has the mandate to provide the basis for a single, coherent system of measurements throughout the world, traceable to the International System of Units (SI). This task takes many forms, from direct dissemination of units to coordination through international comparisons of national measurement standards.\nFollowing consultation, a draft version of the weights and measures act is presented at each meeting of the General Conference for consideration with the nations accepting the institute being present and agreeing on a vote of confirmation for the new units."

 ei_institution_events.1.d:0 "A remarkable treatise on the nature of the universe has been published in the [institution_origin.Owner.GetAdjective] province of [institution_origin.GetName]. The work titled 'On the revolution of the Celestial Spheres' offers new evidence that the earth revolves around the sun, and not the other way around. While this is not a new idea, the method by which the astronomer reached this conclusion is. He claims that all knowledge should be based on rigorous testing of theory against the observed reality. \n\nOnce this principle dubbed 'Empiricism' catches on, it could change the very idea of what science is. Other scholars are already debating the merits of this method and proposing amendments and counterpoints. While a consensus on experiments is still far in the future, this marks the beginning of the establishment of the scientific method."

 ei_institution_events.2.t:0 "Standing Armies!"
 ei_institution_events.2.d:0 "For most of the medieval period, levy armies, militias and mercenaries have been the predominant way of organizing armies. At the beginning of the modern era, things have started to shift. During the Italian wars of the late 15th and early 16th century, condottieri and other mercenaries were still the most prominent forces, but even those are starting to lose their luster, as did levies before them. In this new era of centralized states and fledgling empires, the need for a professional and permanent military emerged:0 The concept of 'Standing Armies' was established. \n\nStarting in the [institution_origin.Owner.GetAdjective] province of [institution_origin.GetName], the professionalization of state militaries is starting to spread across the world. Permanently salaried soldiers, academies for officers and the steady competition for the newest innovation in war will surely follow. This is truly the beginning of a new era of warfare."

 ei_institution_events.3.t:0 "Rationalism!"
 ei_institution_events.3.d:0 "With the advent of Empiricism and the challenge it poses to classical philosophy, the emergence of a counter-movement inspired by classical philosophy seemed inevitable. 'Rationalism' represents a branch of philosophy that is concerned with logic, reasoning, and the generation of knowledge through reason alone. While most of the philosophers that follow this new way of thinking do not dismiss Empiricism as false, they do consider it an inferior way of creating knowledge.  \n\nStarting in the [institution_origin.Owner.GetAdjective] province of [institution_origin.GetName], the new philosophical movement is spreading across the world and providing new insights into what is and what should be. In time, and through a grand synthesis with other revolutionary ideas, Rationalism would become a cornerstone of the scientific revolution taking place in the 17th and 18th century."

 ei_institution_events.4.t:0 "Central Banks!"
 ei_institution_events.4.d:0 "The history of banking reaches far into antiquity and has experienced many developments. Advancements in bookkeeping, credits, insurance and the establishment of stock markets have made it easier to transfer and invest money safely. Throughout the medieval and early modern period, the role of the state in this was defined as a borrower. Even the most powerful states, or more often the heads of state, were indebted to private banks. But due to their power to avoid foreclosure, monarchs often defaulted, making the financial system rather unstable. \n\nWith the establishment of a central bank in [institution_origin.GetName], the [institution_origin.Owner.GetAdjective] government intends to change all of this. Having merged multiple important banking houses and placing them directly under state control, the government hopes to achieve a greater control of the monetary system and secure access to capital markets. While the primary goal is to reliably take and repay loans, the bankers of [institution_origin.GetName] are already thinking about the future of monetary policy."

 ei_institution_events.5.d:0 "The revolutionary citizens in the [institution_origin.Owner.GetAdjective] province of [institution_origin.GetName] have made a great declaration concerning the weights and measures used by all people. The articles of the Weights and Measures include things such as a standard weight for mass, volume, length, height, and dimensions. They are all equal and decimalised, making trade easier and more consistent, and allows us to create a new method of ensuring quality and proper volumes. Before the law, traders could cut corners and give us a bad deal. \nImportantly, the declaration states that these weights and measures, inalienable, unchanging and sacred, implying they apply to humans everywhere and allowing the creation of scales of intricate accuracy.\n\n Starting in the [institution_origin.Owner.GetAdjective] province of [institution_origin.GetName] these noble ideas spread across the world to transform the roles of naval trade ships and merchants forever, starting a new age of trade away from scrupulous people."
