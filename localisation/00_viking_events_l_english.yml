 hellenic_events.14.b:0 "So be it."

 hellenic_events.15.d:0 "The successful implementation of our recent reforms has resulted in some distress, both among the nobles and among the Huaca-worshippers in the countryside, who feel left behind. They feel we are abandoning the ancient customs of both ours, and their forefathers and fear that this development will decrease their power and influence.\nThese dissenters have now joined forces with one of the influential Panaca lineages to put a candidate of their own on the throne."

 hellenic_events.113.t:0 "Crisis of Faith"
 hellenic_events.113.d:0 "You acted cynically toward your patron god but didn't get punished, you prayed and received no reply.

 bendtheknee.5.d:0 "The Holy Roman Empire was established in the year 800 under Charlemagne. Later emperors were also crowned by the pope or other Catholic bishops. Successors of Charlemagne were crowned in Rome for several centuries, where they received the imperial crown in St. Peter's from the pope. The election of a Holy Roman Emperor was generally a two-stage process whereby, from at least the 13th century, the King of the Romans was elected by a small body of the greatest princes of the Empire, the prince-electors. This was then followed shortly thereafter by his coronation as Emperor by the Pope. In 1356, the Emperor Charles IV promulgated the Golden Bull, which became the fundamental law by which all future kings and emperors were elected."

A person found guilty must forfeit all their goods and chattels, their lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all of their rents and annuities. Enforcement, however, is difficult due to the sheer number of potential recusants, and so we should focus our efforts on the most concerning offenders.\n\nPopery is a particularly heinous crime. As the Pope denies the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], so too must faithful Catholics, and thus all Catholics may be considered traitors to the state.\n\nRadical nonconformists such as the Puritans may also be targeted by these laws should they stray too far from the established doctrines of the Church.\n\nThe law enforces the uniformity of religious belief in $COUNTRY$, but it might also be used to discourage factionalism within the court.

A monthly or even quarterly sermon is adequate according to the law, which is usually lifted directly from the Book of Homilies.\n\nMany parishioners desire a more personal and involved approach to religious services, and have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to pay for educated lecturers to preach in their towns. These lecturers however do not always have the most orthodox of theological views. It is often the case that the most eager to preach are those with the most radical ideas, and so these private sermons have become associated with the Puritan movement.\n\nWhile there are advantages to a more religiously literate populace, cracking down on Puritanism would increase the authority of the Church."

 lollard_events.5.d:0 "Dissatisfied with the conservative establishment of the Lollard Church, a group of Puritans writing under the pseudonym ‘Martin Marprelate’ began publishing a series of scathing pamphlets directed at the Church leadership. The Bishops of $COUNTRY$, according to these writers, are ‘proud, popish, presumptuous, profane, paltry, pestilent and pernicious prelates’ who usurp authority from God.\n\nThese tracts have garnered public attention and risk making a mockery of the Establishment lest something be done about them."

 lollard_events.6.d:0 "The doctrines of the Lollard Church are contained within the Book of Common Prayer. It is a book that needs periodic revisions to accord with changes in Lollard thought, as it shifts between more radical and more traditional theology. The most recent edition contains material that has greatly angered the people of [prayer_book_province.GetName], many of whom still cling to Catholic dogmas and practices. They have risen up in revolt, demanding that the Book be reverted to its previous edition."

 lollard_events.7.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Reformation did not sway the hearts and minds of the entire population. Many continue to harbour Catholic sympathies, even among the court. It has been discovered that $STATESMAN$ has been secretly attending a Catholic Mass, a practice strictly forbidden by law. If exposed, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] stands to lose all of [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] land and property, and will no longer be eligible for public office."

 lollard_events.8.t:0 "Prayers to Saints"
 lollard_events.8.d:0 "When $COUNTRY$ broke with Rome, we did away with the superstitious notion that prayers should be directed to the Saints rather than to God himself. As our new theology has no place for the papist concept of Purgatory, there is no need for Saints to intercede on behalf of our souls. Despite this, many people continue the practice of praying to Saints, and many churches give excessive reverence to their patron."

 lollard_events.9.t:0 "Abolition of Feast Days"
 lollard_events.9.d:0 "The Catholic liturgical calendar is filled with feast days that function as public holidays and occasions for celebration. No longer under Papal authority, our own Church must decide how far this practice ought to continue. Those most fervent reformers argue that superfluous holidays encourage sinful temptation and distract from gainful labor. This has been met with broad agreement in terms of theology, but abolishing feast days is likely to upset the populace who do so enjoy the occasional day off."

 lollard_events.10.t:0 "Puritans Leaving for the Colonies"
 lollard_events.10.d:0 "The Puritans have for some time criticized the hierarchy and doctrines of the Church of $COUNTRY$. The Reformation has to their eyes merely replaced the Pope with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they openly denounce the state’s slothful attitude to reform. Theological disputes aside, Puritans have also been persecuted as nonconformists, depending on the leanings of the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Finally exhausted by the religious affairs of Europe, many Puritans have decided to migrate in the New World. They have organized themselves into a colonial company an requested a charter to establish new settlements in the Americas."

 lollard_events.11.t:0 "Controversy over Vestments"
 lollard_events.11.d:0 "The matter of clerical vestments remains a contentious issue in the Lollard Church. The extravagant and superstitious rags of the papists are surely to be done away with, but the degree of austerity required of the clergy continues to inflame debate and protest.\n\nConservative Lollards wish to reinstate some of the elaborate trappings of the old Catholic priesthood, while moderates argue that a simple surplice is sufficient. Radical reformers insist that vestments are not merely lacking scriptural support, but deface and corrupt the ordinances which God has instituted."

 lollard_events.12.t:0 "Smashing Altars"
 lollard_events.12.d:0 "The early years of the English Reformation are a time of fervent iconoclasm. Any adornment or relic that even suggests Papism, the existence of Purgatory, or the divinity of saints is being ruthlessly stripped from the churches. Anything that could lead the laity astray must be destroyed; altars are smashed, paintings painted over, shrines ruined.\n\nA perpetual issue for the new Lollard Church is the matter of how far this iconoclasm should be taken. Some more radical reformers push for an end to roods, candlesticks, and crucifixes, while others seek the restoration of some of the more harmless ornaments."
 lollard_events.12.a:0 "Smash the altars and imprison papist protesters!"

 lollard_events.12.c:0 "Put an end to this iconoclasm."
 lollard_events.13.t:0 "Catholic Instigators"
 lollard_events.13.d:0 "Though $COUNTRY$ has formally split from the Rome, the Pope continues to meddle in our affairs by orchestrating plots against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Jesuits and priests number among his agents, sheltered by traitorous recusants.\n\nThese crypto-Catholics employ cunning methods of hiding Papist agents from the law, deviously building secret areas behind walls, under the floorboards, and even in concealed underground passageways. Hiding in these 'priest holes' can injure or even suffocate their occupants, so they are at least unlikely to be able to make a quick escape once located."

 lollard_events.14.t:0 "The Church of $COUNTRY$"
 lollard_events.14.d:0 "As the Lutheran Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favoring the Lutheran cause and others defending the traditional religion.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Lutheran, Catholic, nor Calvinist, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God."
 lollard_events.15.t:0 "Nonconformist Monarch"
 lollard_events.15.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has landed in the unenviable position of being both a religious nonconformist and the Supreme Governor of the Church of $COUNTRY$. The Lollards of $COUNTRY$ struggle to tolerate this state of affairs, and the legitimacy of the Church is dramatically weakened."

The exploits of Leif Eriksen and his followers have pushed the boundaries of what the Norwegians know to be true, and yet, they met some of the Vinlandic people themselves.

It seems they remember the days of King Sigurd Syr, and his persecution of the Asatruans was one of the reasons they left.

No one being, no matter how powerful, can control absolutely everything without going mad. I mean, even I go mad sometimes, and I am only controlling a small corner of the world!\n\nI think it is time I denouce the Christ god, and openly revere the true Asatruan gods of Odin, Thor, Frey, Snotra and all others that come from the nine realms!

 kushite_religion_title:0 "Kushite Clerics ask question about faith"
 kushite_religion_desc:0 "Upon restoring our nation of Kush, the clerical class have uncovered ancient documents which hold more of a truth than our current religious beliefs. It refers to the Canaanite religion. The Canaanite religion according to the documents, were group of ancient Semitic religious practices by the Canaanites living in the ancient Levant through to the Sudanese region from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries AD. Canaanite religion was polytheistic and, in some cases, monolatristic. Like other people of the Ancient Near East the Canaanite families typically focused on veneration of the dead in the form of household gods and goddesses, the Elohim, while acknowledging the existence of other deities such as Baal and El, Mot, Qos, Asherah and Astarte. Many have already adopted the faith, and some have gone into hiding, but the question asked is, can perhaps encourage those to come forth and be our guides or should we stay with our current religious practices?"
