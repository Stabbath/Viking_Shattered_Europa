 ANZ_arabian_prominence:0 "Arabian Prominence"
 ANZ_arabian_prominence_desc:0 "The other tribes of Anizah were far more prominent in the events of late pre-Islamic Arabia and the early Islamic era. According to historians such as Al-Tabari (10th century CE), Anizah joined with Bakr ibn Wa'il under an alliance they called 'al-Lahazim'."
 ANZ_in_najd:0 "Anizah In Najd"

 ANZ_many_tribes:0 "Tribes Of Anizah"
 ANZ_many_tribes_desc:0 "Two main tribal branches of Anizah are recorded by the early Muslim scholars. One branch was nomadic, living in the northern Arabian steppes bordering Syria and Mesopotamia. The other, known as Bani Hizzan, was sedentary, living within the wadis of the district of Al-Yamama."
 ANZ_the_ruwullah:0 "The Ruwullah"
 ANZ_the_ruwullah_desc:0 "One branch of the Anizah in that area, centered around Al-Jouf and the valley of Wadi Sarhan and extending into Jordan and Syria, became so large and powerful that it practically developed into an independent tribe, known as the Ruwallah. The Ruwallah engaged in battle with other branches of Anizah, and also became the arch-enemy of the large tribe of Shammar."
 ANZ_crop_levies:0 "Crop Levies"
 ANZ_crop_levies_desc:0 " Although not farmers themselves, the Anizah levied crops from the inhabitants of their land, and only spent the winter months in the area, while migrating northwards into southern Syria in the summer months, where they collected tribute from the inhabitants of the Hawran region."

 ARB_custodian_of_islam_desc:0 "Custodian of Islam, Servant of the Two Noble Sanctuaries or Protector of the Two Holy Cities, is a royal style that has been used by many Muslim rulers, including the Ayyubids, the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt, and the Ottoman Sultans. The title was sometimes regarded to denote the de facto Caliph of Islam, but it mainly refers to the ruler taking the responsibility of guarding and maintaining the two holiest mosques in Islam. The Al-Haram Mosque or The Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, both of which are in the Hejazi region of Arabia."
 ARB_pillar_of_islam_desc:0 "The final Pillar of Islam is the Hajj, or pilgrimage. During one’s life, a Muslim is required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca during the 12th month of the lunar calendar. This ritual consists of making journey to Mecca wearing only 2 white sheets so all of the pilgrims are identical and there is no class distinction among them. Such a journey allows a person to focus and move with the blessing of Allah behind them, leading them with a swift pace."
 ARB_revival_of_strength_desc:0 "In 1206, Genghis Khan established a powerful dynasty among the Mongols of central Asia. During the 13th century, this Mongol Empire conquered most of the Eurasian land mass, including both China in the east and much of the old Islamic caliphate. An uprising of Arabian tribes eventually led to the Mongols leaving the region and Arabs having dominance over their own lands."
 ARB_astrology_desc:0 "A number of medieval thinkers and scientists living under Islamic rule played a role in transmitting Islamic science to the Christian West. In addition, the period saw the recovery of much of the Alexandrian mathematical, geometric and astronomical knowledge, such as that of Euclid and Claudius Ptolemy. These recovered mathematical methods were later enhanced and developed by other Islamic scholars."
 ARB_kaaba_desc:0 "The Kaaba, is a building at the center of the most important mosque in Islam, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. It is the most sacred site in Islam. It is considered by Muslims to be the Bayt Allah or House of God and is the qibla or direction of prayer for Muslims around the world when performing salah."
 ARB_architecture_desc:0 "As power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids, the architectural styles changed also. The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the Sasanian Empire, utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco. Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the Empire."
 ARB_technology_desc:0 "During this period the Muslim world was a cauldron of cultures which collected, synthesized and significantly advanced the knowledge gained from the Roman, Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, North African, Ancient Greek and Medieval Greek civilizations. In virtually every field of endeavor—in astronomy, alchemy, mathematics, medicine, optics and so forth Arabic scientists were in the forefront of scientific advance."

Lasting from about the 5th century to the 12th century, it saw great developments for the Avar people and the cementing of the Avar people in the Caucuses.

 three_hearts_three_cities_desc:0 "Some call them our three hearts, but in reality they are our three key cities. Cempoala (the place of twenty waters) was the nominal ruler of the Totonacapan Kingdom; Teayo (tortoise atop stone) is the place where we see a mix of various cultures such as Toltax, Mexica, and Huastec; and Taijin is perhaps our greatest city, being inhabited for countless generations (until being burned down in a fire in the 1200's) and being situated along key trade routes along with preserving leftovers from the ancient city of Teotihuacan. With all the successor to Taijin along with the other two cities working together in harmony, we will be able to plan and develop Totonac culture and society further than we've ever thought possible."

 perfection_of_ceramics_sculpting_architecture_desc:0 "We are known for our craft work in pottery, ceramins, sculptures, and architecture. There are several who marvel at the works of our cities and people and if we continue to steadily increase our production of said works and continue developing our unique styles, there is no doubt that the Totonacs will be a truly prestigious trading power in the region."
 ceremonial_centers:0 "Ceremonial Centers"
 ceremonial_centers_desc:0 "We have several centers where ceremonies, both religious and cultural, take place. The upkeep of them is tough at times, but the effort is well worth it due to the strengthening of our faith through them. Building more and refining our traditions done at these centers will do not only the commoners good, but our priestly class and noble class as well; we just simply need to ease them into these upcoming reforms."
 non_human_sacrifices:0 "Non-Human Sacrifices"
 non_human_sacrifices_desc:0 "Contrary to those around us such as the Aztecs, we do not practice human sacrifice... All the time. Our goddess of maize deemed such sacrifices unworthy and not needed, so instead we give herbs, flowers, and animal sacrifices instead. Such people who might normally be used for human sacrifices can instead be put to work in Totonac society instead, developing the land that is uncultivated... And if they disobey, the god of the sun will have them and their hearts."
 preserving_totonac_culture:0 "Preserving Totonac Culture"
 preserving_totonac_culture_desc:0 "There are several who would see Totonac culture be absorbed into their own and these influences are spreading throughout Totonac society. We must begin to build and keep a unique cultural identity compared to those around us and make our court distinctivly Totonac, rather than perhaps Aztec, Huastec, or Zapotec. It will take some time, but our court will become the bastion and beacon of Totonac culture, long enough for others to sprout up elsewhere."
 against_the_aztecs:0 "Against the Aztecs"
 against_the_aztecs_desc:0 "That triple alliance to the west of us... It threatens our very way of life. Totonac warriors, priests, and commoners alike know the threat the Aztecs are when they are united and this alliance that has formed is nothing short of a ticking threat waiting to exterminate the Totonac people. We need to harden ourselves and prepare our warriors for a fearless campaign against them and any who would support them, and even when the Aztecs are defeated, we must still ready ourselves for what other threats to the Totonacs there may be."
 rebuilding_taijin:0 "Rebuilding Taijin"
 rebuilding_taijin_desc:0 "Burned down in a fire so long ago, but still within our memory. Taijin must not ever be forgotten and its place must be kept sacred within the hearts of the Totonac people. Rebuilding it will be a large undertaking, but completing it will assure us the loyalty and unity of the Totonac people altogether. Let us go forth and trace our steps back to our foundation, and mend the cracks that are there, freeing Totonac society to be whole once again."

But the place where the sand and eye meet, it does not obscure vision, it only emboldens the resolve of its people and makes them more willing to stand for what they believe in.

Much has changed since the end of said civil war and the political, religious, military, and diplomatic landscape of the Mayan homeland has changed significantly, but stil the memory remains in many that we were the true and legitimate successors to the league.

 mayan_long_and_short_count_desc:0 "The calendar system developed by Mesoamerican people has been widely used and varied, but only under the Mayan people has it been perfected! It records lunar and solar cycles as well as when eclipses happen and the movement of certain planetary bodies with great accuracy. The Long Count as well as the abbreviated Short Count, starting from a fixed start point and integral the cyclical nature of Mayan religion, will continue to be used throughout our lands and give a great amount of authority and cohesivness to our religious practices."

It was not, however, destined to last as some centuries later, it all came apart in a disastrous civil war, causing the cities to break away one by one. It is our duty to see the cities reunited under the same idea and notion that Ah Mekat Tutul Xiu had; there must be unification amongst the Mayan people, not division."

Still, this time of ancient warfare and expansion left a distinct mark on the Zapotec people; it has hardened them and made them ready for warfare on all sides, whether or not friends are by their side."

 monte_alban_our_old_heart_desc:0 "Our old Empire's heart was the populous center of Monte Alban. It was here that the Zapotec people thrived and expanded from for centuries before being eclipsed by other cities, but who is to say this old heart of ours is left to rot? There is life in it yet, and the Zapotec people can still revitalize it and become the grand political entity it once was, but even greater!"

 destroy_regional_powers_and_unite_desc:0 "Regional powers are an existential threat to the Atepetl of the Zapotec people.

 reform_zapotec_writing_and_language_desc:0 "Our writing and language systems are some of the oldest in the region, but like others around us, it gets mixed toegther and changed around thanks to the influence of other cultures around us. It would be wise of us to reform the Zapotec writing system and language altogether and codify both so that there is a distinct and unique Zapotec identity that also helps adminsitrative matters flow with ease."

 trading_in_obsidian_and_jade_desc:0 "Some of the most prized resources in the region, jade and obsidian, are traded as luxury goods in Zapotec lands and throughout the regions around us.

The ambitious Zapotec people are eager to retake what they lost and beyond this, take what they see as rigthfully belonging to the Zapotec people.

 recovery_from_the_mongol_invasion_desc:0 "In the midst of the 1300s, as the once great Mongol Empire was split up and the successor states were tearing themselves apart, Bukhara was still feeling the ravages of what the Mongols did to the city. We must never forget how these scars on our heart came to be, but we must also not let them bind us into the past; we must recover and become a prosperous center of culture, art, learning, and trade for all of Central Asia just as we once were."

During the time of the Samanids, Bukhara's people may have still worshipped idols at times along with others following Islam, but their work at building Bukhara up made it into an intellectual center of the Islamic world. If we are to truly succeed our past, we must meet this legacy and transcend it with our work in all facets of the state, whether it be in religion, in politics, or in society itself."

We have seen what kind of marvels settled life can bring and what achievements in thought and innovation the public can bring about if they are educated enough; indeed much of the Persian heartland and its history is an example of this and we would do well to follow this example and begin large efforts to improve the education of the Bukharan populace."

 settling_from_the_steppe_desc:0 "In no way is it easy to go from nomadic and semi-nomadic steppe life to settled life; the culture of the people changes and so to does the politics that stem from them. We are not without experience in this matter, however, as we have been attempting to handle this matter for decades now and will continue to do so as time goes on. There is no panacea to this drastic change in life styles for thousands upon thousands of people, but our administrative efforts can certainly attempt to help them out."

 utilizing_fire_and_shock_desc:0 "If there is one thing that Bukhara will need for its survival, it is a strong military sector. Protecting the archives and scholars and attracting more requires safe passage and safe cities, no? Therefore we must not stay stagnant in our ways of the past with largely cavalry-based armies that use shock tactics primarily. We should be looking to modernize and adapt our weapons so that we can compete with other states around us, but also we must recognize that our traditional fighting style still does offer advantages in certain situations. Much like how Bukhara is a merging of cultures and traditions, it can be the sight of merging fighting styles."

 persian_cannoneer_experience_desc:0 "The Persian people, though at times hostile to us and at other times friendly to us, are skilled in their usage of new weapons, especially the larger caliber ones that are found in sieges and extensive military engagements.

Though it was not so grand at its start, we have worked hard to build up its defensive structures so that raids and attacks against us would yield little results. Even though we rely heavily on old khanate traditions, there is some wisdom in keeping certain positions locked down and heavily fortified."

 tajik_mercenary_fighters_desc:0 "Mercenaries around us are plentiful and always willing to fight if we have the money to spend, and in particular the Tajik people are usually offering Uzbek states and khanates lower prices than other states due to our familial connections. Taking advantage of these blood ties can be advantageous for us when we are in a tight spot and in the future we can expand the connections we have to other mercenary groups around the steppe."

At various points they have seen rises in power throughout Central Asia since they have been favored local and regional administrators. Perhaps we could use their service too and appoint various khojas to positions of authority in Kokand... After ensuring that they are loyal to us, of course."

 preventing_civil_wars_desc:0 "Like most other khanates we too are prone to collapse from internal strife and succession crises. Reforming laws of succession are tough as it is, but Kokand is in need of strong central authority that has an administrative body built around it, not just a lone holder of power that rules through blood and iron. If Kokand is to survive into the future, there will need to be hefty changes to our old traditions."

Whilst Kokand is by no means the first contender in this matter, it can strive to be the final unifying state that comes out on top and unites all of the Uzbek people into a solidified state. Doing so would bring not only unparalleled prosperity, but also a great sense of joy to the various Uzbek people."

To our south in the lands of Persia, we see sprawling cities such as Herat and Samarkand that thrive off trade and production from hard working and settled citizens; to our north and east, the endless steppe yields the same things century after century with very little change. Perhaps it is time we strike the earth and plant our banner in it once and for all, settling our people down slowly and founding new cities for the entirety of Kokand."

Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."

 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc:0 "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."

 weak_religious_institutions_desc:0 "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of Mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."

 khanate_rivalries_desc:0 "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control. The Nogai Horde, however, can actively challenge these claims to authority and fight them over legitimacy on the steppe that we inhabit.

 fluid_political_organization_desc:0 "Due to our spread out population and vast, open territory, politics in the Nogai Horde is much more akin to that of flowing water that rarely impeded by blockages, whereas we see kingdoms and Empires around us that encounter countless issues with centralized governments and numerous advisors.

 degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc:0 "Authority from the west is no longer what it used to be. The Slavic people of Muscovy and Novgorod are actively making attempts to take over what land was part of the Golden Horde, similar to us in the east. The waning authority also gives us more freedom to govern our realm as we see fit; we no longer need to pay tribute or service to a ruler from so far away in the west who was often dealing with much more pressing matters."

As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou.

Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors.

We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."

 knowledge_of_raids_and_privateering_desc:0 "Since our path to independence, the Haitian people (civilians and soldiers alike) have observed the uncouth ways of conducting warfare around us. Raiding on land and at sea and taking off before the enemy can catch you, it's dishonorable and harsh in all the right ways! These tactics that we employed in our fight for independence should become regular strategies we use in whatever battle we find ourselves in!"

 lucrative_plantations_of_haiti_desc:0 "Though our independence brought a slight drop in economic activity around Haitian land and Haitian coasts, we are very much still a profitable nation.

 utilize_water_ways_desc:0 "Rivers, where would be without rivers? They're a great way of transporting goods to far away places with less work (most of the time), they provide a source of water to us, and they also help indicate where other potentially friendly settlements might be. The more we can use the rivers to our advantage in terms of trade and business deals, the better off we will be as a whole."
 tenuous_borders:0 "Finding the Real Borders"
 tenuous_borders_desc:0 "Due to where we are situated, borders are less cut-and-dry compared to other places that are more heavily inhabited by dense cities and dedicated roads. As a result, we're often redefining where our borders are at the local level with various communities and towns on the border with our neighbors.

 confederation_vs_federation_desc:0 "Many within Argentina debate as to how the provinces should be governed from the central administrative body and roughly they fall into two categories:0 Unitarians and Federalists.

 settle_federalist_vs_centralist_disputes_desc:0 "The politics of our young nation are turbulent and fiery, but what does one expect from being founded upon the fires of war against an former colonial overlord? We are going to need to look toward easing tensions between various political factions and ensuring that the governing body in Argentina is capable of handling corruption in whatever form it takes."
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries:0 "Suppress Counter-revolutionary Zeal"
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries_desc:0 "Some say it is not possible, but reality is so rarely what we want it to be. There are some who would indeed rise up against Argentina and return it to the greedy hands of our former colonial overlords. These counter-revolutionaries are some of the worst threats to Argentina and we will need to fight them off at every turn when they rise up. They lack the faith that others do in an independent Argentina; we will show they just how wrong they are."
 watch_for_caudillos:0 "Watch for Caudillos"
 watch_for_caudillos_desc:0 "Caudillos, a taboo word of sorts in our land. It stands for militarist politician who seeks to govern from the top down according to his will and those with unflinching loyalty to him. We need to watch for these abhorrent people rising up in the ranks of the Argetine administration, for if they have their way with the government, the entire dream of an independent and unified Argentina could easily collapse in on itself."

Cavalry and artillery take a less prominent role when fighting near the great river and infantry are at the heart of the fighting and it is because of this that our men are some of the most resilient in the region."

 regular_river_crossing_desc:0 "Crossing the great Mississippi River is no easy task for a commander or general, but it can certainly be done with enough supplies and effort. We need to be training our future commanders to navigate river crossings both small and large with ease so that they are able to use river crossings either to their advantage or nullify the major effect it might have on a battle they're engaged in."

 starting_of_plantations_desc:0 "Agriculture in Louisiana, especially southward toward the open sea, is hard to cultivate since marshland and swampy terrain is just not suitable for widescale farms and plantations. We need to open up tracts of land in the more hospitable areas of Louisiana and begin the construction of proper plantations and farm estates so that we can start producing food on a large scale. Perhaps in time, we'll start growing other goods too on the new plantations."

 sustainable_harbors_desc:0 "In order to have a proper navy, we are going to need suitable harbors and shipyards. This wouldn't be an issue in most other coastal places, but for Louisiana and its wetlands, we need to get creative with our harbors and shipyards. We will need to engineer some well-built structures that can be used on less-than-ideal terrain and once we obtain some good coastal lands, we need to ensure that our harbors and shipyards there are also built in a very similar fashion."
 vie_for_gulf_control:0 "The Battles for the Gulf"
 vie_for_gulf_control_desc:0 "Controlling the trade in the gulf to our immediate south is a priority of ours since a lot of our trade comes through there.

 the_marshland_masters:0 "Marshland Masters"
 the_marshland_masters_desc:0 "What fighting we've done and what civil cultivation of the land we've done in the harsh terrain of Louisiana has trained us to be resilient and hardworking people. Our former colonial masters may think of us as little upstarts who need to get back in line eventually, but we'll show them just how wrong they are about the Lousianian people. Let them land on our shores, and let them drown in their own blood mixed with the water."
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river:0 "The Mississippi River"
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river_desc:0 "The great Mississippi River is a very defining feature of the region we reside in and it is perhaps the key defining factor about Louisiana itself. So many people depend on it for their own lives and for making money off of trade, we would be fools to try to close it down to only ourselves. We should be attracting any and all merchants that we can and invite them in so that they too can share in the glory of the mighty Mississippi River."

 rising_tide_of_liberty_desc:0 "Liberty is something Peruvians have desired for a long while, but it was out of reach for so many years. Alas, our day had finally come and gone and revolutionary fervor peaked when our independence was at hand, but what now? We cannot let that flame of liberty just die away, we must keep the torch lit so that other nations of the Americas may follow our path! We can help our brothers and sisters across the continent be free from colonial oppression!"

 natural_peruvian_fortifications_desc:0 "Utilizing the Andes Mountains is part of our defensive military doctrine is certainly a plus, but building modern fortifications into or on the mountains themselves can really cut down on fortification maintenance.

 pacific_bound_trade:0 "Pacific Ocean Traders"
 pacific_bound_trade_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is lucrative for trade, especially since vessels capable of faring the large swaths of water are becoming very common.

We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature.

Siding with one side or the other will invoke the ire of another side and possible revolts throughout the land or it could invoke retribution from outside the state.

These smaller states were subjects of at times Srivijaya, Chinese powers, or Majapahit, but all contributed to the culmination of a greater Bruneian identity as time went on.

The states to our west are seeking to convert our people and snuff out the lasting legacy of Hinduism in Blambangan, but we shall not let them!

We have learned to defend ourselves first, before taking to attacking others, and this defenisve mentality must be promoted over time if Barrois land is to remain safe and secure. Better defensive measures will be found and implemented; the walls and garrisons of Bar will not go down without a fight fit for the ages."

As a result, when titles were changed and cities shifted hands, power struggles emerged over miscommunication and various disputes, the prime example we have being the disputes between Savoy and Dauphine over cities like Voiron and la Cota-Saint-Andre and the Faucigny.

 welf_pieces_desc:0 "The Welf Dynasty is something of a prestigious and well-known name throughout Central Europe, but it was never truly a centralized dynasty that could cultivate power and challenge other strong dynasties. The way inheritance went in the Welf Dynasty meant that its holdings got split up time and time again, leaving it with very little central power unfortunately. We of Calenberg are holders of one of these 'Welf pieces' and therefore our legitimacy in this land is helped by that alone, but finding connections in our family to the Welf Dynasty could always help us in that sense too."

This position may not be that common outside of the Holy Roman Empire but inside its borders, such a title brings with it more power than one might anticipate. If we of Calenberg can elevate our the power of our own Vogtei through various means (not excluding military conquest), then we will certainly be able to command more authority in our home region."

Though Calenberg has traditionally been thought of as an undeveloped piece of land fit for only petty local authorities, Calenberg Castle stands as a place where we can project a growing sense of power from.

 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald_desc:0 "Calenberg has traditionally been known as the Lower Forest (Unterwald) whilst our other familial area, Gottingen, has been traditionally known as the Upper Forest (Oberwald). Whilst the forests do impede land development to a degree, we have proven with Calenberg Castle that developing our land is not impossible. Putting more funds toward developing strong infrastructure would actually help Calenberg a lot in comparison to other places in Central Europe, so both the Lower and Upper Forest can be of great use to us in the future as new forestry techniques come to light."

Now Calenberg is put face-to-face with religious tension unlike anything it has ever had to deal with, but which path is the righteous one? Which one do our people support? No matter the path that is chosen, we will take this time to concentrate on local affairs so that such a religious split like this does not spell the end for Calenberg."

Cultivating this power and influence amongst various cities and small princes will help them recognize our power when they eventually come into our fold."

No other fair was to be held up to a mile (1.6 km) away (Marktbann), and the bridges and streets were freed from toll. The Michaelmas fair was held at the church of St. Nikolai, built in 1176. At this time, there were fairs at other Saxon towns like Freiberg, Leisnig, Pegau, and Regis as well. In 1268 all foreign merchants travelling to or living in Leipzig got safe conduct for their persons and their goods, even if their Rulers were at war with Saxony. This led to the settlement of numerous merchants in Leipzig. Trade goods now included herring, cloth, wine, and pepper."

 the_diocese_of_passau_desc:0 "As the successor to the Diocese of Lorch, we of Passau are endowed with power and authority but only in a limited area as of today. Though some would overlook our humble diocese as nothing more than a place of Bavarians and Austrians gathering to worship, many know the great reputation Passau has from its past alongside its greatly rebuilt monasteries. This reputation will only serve to enhance the trust we have from our own people, and it will help pave the way for a bright future in Passau."
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf:0 "Stamp of the Wolf"
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf_desc:0 "If there is one matter that Passau is becoming known for as the Age of Exploration makes its way across the Old World, it is that bladed weapon manufacturing is a key component of Passau's prosperity! Our smiths stamp the blades with the glorious Passau wolf, a simplified rendering of our coat-of-arms that ensures that all know exactly where the balde has come from. These high quality weapons may not be the best against muskets but they do inspire a great many stories of heroism amongst those who use them, especially the soldiers of our own ranks."
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau:0 "Inviting Religious Orders"
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau_desc:0 "To help spread the good word of Passau to other parts of Europe, we should be willing to invite in various high-ranking officials from the holy orders around Europe. Franciscans, Dominicans, even Jesuits would be fitting to invite to our land so that in the future, we may attract future theologians, philosophers, artists, and other skilled people of various professions."
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau:0 "Heresy! Everywhere!"
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau_desc:0 "The Protestant Reformation does not waver in its effort to bring about ruin and destruction across the whole of the Holy Roman Empire. From east to west and north to south, princes and bishops turn on each other so that one religious side may triumph claim that they have the truest interpretation of the Bible, its theology, and the doctrines of faith itself. Passau is caught in the middle of these violent clashes and will need to choose a side before one side enforces its religious demands upon the other in our own land."
 who_should_rule_over_passau:0 "A Powerful Question to Passau"
 who_should_rule_over_passau_desc:0 "Who can rule over Passau is not an easy question to answer as some think they should be elected from a religious background instead of a meritocratic background. There are also others who think noble blood stands out and should be enthroned to Passau's highest position, but we care not for these trivial aspects. What we need to focus on is where our candidate comes from. If they come from a Bavarian family, an Austrian family, a Bohemian family, or perhaps some other family in general, they will grant us certain advantages when it comes to relations with those around us."

 revoke_the_power_from_vienna_desc:0 "Vienna is so beloved by the Austrians and Papacy that it got its own diocese... How wonderful... Though some rejoice that Vienna got this attention, we of Passau resent it greatly! The ecclesiastic power of Vienna partly comes at a cost of our ecclesiastic power! The Diocese of Vienna will not stand forever, and we of Passau will be dedicated to retaking what power was taken from us. After all is done, the various deacons and priests and other holy officials that would've gone to Vienna can instead come to Passau, as they always should have done."
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence:0 "The Taste of Power"
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence_desc:0 "We have tasted power in the past and as of late, though we are not in a strong position to challenge strong states around us. Even to defend ourselves, the forces of Passau are rather small and weak, ineffective at stopping any advance from neighboring princes that might be eager to dismantle our power. Taking measures to formalize and build up the military potential of Passau should be an steady project for all inside our borders."

 an_old_catholic_see_desc:0 "Since centuries ago, after the Wendish Crusade, our small bit of land has been home to the Ruppiner See. Though not as large as other Catholic dioceses or bishoprics, it has been here for long enough that it has ties to various parts of the land that now go under new names. If we can project its claims out further, we'll be sure to have an easier time expanding without repurcussions."

 redo_our_town_walls_desc:0 "As old as our town is (alongside Neuruppin), the town walls erected around our central place of authority are not what they used to be.

 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation_desc:0 "The Protestant Reformation has reached toward Ruppin just as it has reached toward every other part of Europe, yet for some it has been more damaging than rectifying. We of Ruppin must do our best to resolve the conflicts between Catholics, Protestants, Baptists, Calvinists, and whatever other denomination is within our land so that our own political establishment doesn't succumb to internal religious fissures."

 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness_desc:0 "Our founding between these two signature rivers may be seen to some as mundane, but we know that there is potential in these lands if we can only utilize what production methods we have currently.

Utilizing diplomatic connections in Brandenburg, Saxony, as well as any other states we are near could help in us making moves against our local rivals."

 local_minded_officials_desc:0 "Ruppin is very much a local power, it has been ever since its inception and the people who run our administration know this very well. As such they have come to understand local politics on a much deeper level than most other states like Austria, Bohemia, or Brandenburg. Coming to terms with local politics and local authorities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges to maintaining internal peace and productivity; thankfully we of Ruppin have no trouble in this area."

 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet_dec:0 "We are not thought of as a militaristic place at all, but rather as a place of rural localities and small-time merchants and officials. Such a reputation gives others a sense that we are weak and unable to defend against attacks, but that is far from the truth. Should we be threatened, all of Ruppin will be called upon to help defend the land regardless of their faith or creed. We stand and fight for righteousness in the face of being offered a torturous peace."

 commodity_of_paper_desc:0 "One thing the Great Ravensburg Trading Society has brought to the people of Ravensburg is increased production of paper. It may seem like a simple material, but for books, libraries, and various other tasks in our government, it is absolutely needed. We must keep the produtction of paper rising steadily throughout the coming years if we are to keep on top of our own internal affairs."

 to_side_with_the_holy_see_desc:0 "Various controversies have rocked the Holy Roman Empire over the centuries and Salzburg, being so close to Austria whilst being a Prince-Archbishopric, has had to take sides in the various disputes. We tend to side with the Holy See and see them as the rightful powers in these political arguments which gives a degree of positive reputation with fellow Catholics, and keeping to this honesty will only help Salzburg's reputation grow in the future."
 the_notion_of_a_diet:0 "Convene the Diet of Salzburg"
 the_notion_of_a_diet_desc:0 "Despite being a Prince-Archbishopric, we cannot live without the usual institutions of a standard state. Merchants, peasants, knights and officers, and also clergy are spread throughout Salzburg and have their own interests aside from what we in the administration want. In order to help sort out these desires, we should look to convene some sort of diet for all of Salzburg so that we can better align all parts of the state toward common goals."

 strength_over_the_mercantile_class_desc:0 "The time has come for stricter regulations to come over the merchants and burghers of Salzburg.

Letting the clergy and peasants handle things will be much better for Salzburg later on."
 militarized_prince_bishopric:0 "Extend our Temporal Control"
 militarized_prince_bishopric_desc:0 "Though we are limited partially by our spiritual characteristic bestowed upon us by the Holy See, the influence of the Holy See is not as strong as it once was. We can slowly begin to take military matters into our own hands and start creating a strong military for ourselves. Perhaps even doing conquests in our own name instead of the name of the Papacy?

Rather, the relations between Bremen and Verden have been quite hostile at times since Bremen has more foundational power and thus more ambition.

It yields a great amount of benefits for both of us, though we take it in a different direction than they do since we are more focused on building up internally instead of controlling a myriad of religious territories and such.

They also help organize the Imperial Diet when it convenes, and Verden being part of one of these circles means it can step up into higher level politics as compared to what it can normally get into.

 willing_to_negotiate_desc:0 "Our precarious position at our inception has made us of Jangladesh wary of what exactly our neighbors may against us should relations possibly break down. In order to take preventative measures against such things from happening, we must be willing and open to negotiations will nearly all parties both large and small, internally and externally. If we are willing to come to the table at least and speak about matters, rather than discard certain people or parties outright, we can show ourselves to be a cut above the rest."
 rajput_conflicts:0 "Rajput Conflicts"
 rajput_conflicts_desc:0 "The rajput are rarely ever truly united on a single cause. Clans will disagree greatly on one matter or another and it's only when there is a common enemy for all rajputs that we have seen unity amongst all clans. As such, we must take advantage of this rajput infighting and see if Jangladesh can proclaim itself more than what it seems to be on the surface."

 construction_of_fortifications_desc:0 "Much like other rajput states, we of Jangladesh are going to need to build fortifications and protective barriers against foreign invaders.

We of Junagadh have not had luck in fighting them off and as such have served as their subject in the past.

His invasion and conquest was so harsh and so complete that it resulted in a major migration of Sinhalese people southward on the island itself.

We must work to keep them safe and profitable, for the well being of Jaisalmer."

 jauhar_desc:0 "This seemingly horrid act is a form self-immolation by Hindu women in particular in order avoid capture, enslavement, and other atrocities that could be committed by hostile forces seeking them out in the midst of certain defeat (that is, defeat on the side of the Hindu women). This act has mostly been seen occurring during the various Muslim invasions of the subcontinent and there have been prominent cases of jauhar happening in Jaisalmer's history. It is not a beautiful act, but it is one that signifies prestige amongst the various Hindu states; we will not be conquered nor subjugated so easily by these foreign invaders."
 raiding_hostile_trade:0 "Raiding Hostile Trade"
 raiding_hostile_trade_desc:0 "In times of war or when trade relations have severely broken down between us and our rivals, there is no harm in making their trade sector suffer somewhat.

 anti_siege_attacks_desc:0 "We have since our inception been forced to learn the ways of siege warfare and it isn't easy in the slightest. What we have learned, however, is that sorties and anti-siege attacks from within and from outside fortifications can be extremely useful and it's something we of Jaisalmer should perfect. How and where can we practice? Jaisalmer Fort is a prime target."

Kutch, however, is a victim of their rather consistent in-fighting and feuds that result in a great amount of strain on the administration.

 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch_desc:0 "To transcend tribal politics is marvelous, but getting there is an entirely different story.

For too long we have suffered at the hands of the Sindhi people at the mouth of the Indus River, we must not let their raids beat our people down forever.

We would do well to capitalize on this glass and ceramic idea now before it is too late."

 feudatory_mandala_traditions_desc:0 "With how political matters go in and around Ratanpur, feudatories and mandalas are of no issue to us. Having more of them and having them be loyal to us is a sign of greatness, prestige, and power to many and by ensuring that ours (whether they be governed by family or not) are not rebellious, we can propagate our influence outward."

Would the people of Venad once again be subject to foreign rule? The answer would be no, but the memories of the Chera Kingdom prove to be everlasting in Venad itself and as such, the rulers of our land sometimes go by the title 'Venad Cheras', giving legitimacy in the eyes of the great many who still remember the times of old."

This has to change with future times, however, as we can't continue to allow the tribes to roam and cause havoc on trade and internal connections throughout Tripoli.

We need not halt this change over time, rather, we need to learn how to organize ourselves within these changes and manage how they are implemented throughout our society.

The distinction between Visigoths and Götalanders lasted during the Middle Ages, but the Götalanders became increasingly important for Swedish national claims of greatness due to the Götalanders' old connection with the Goths. They argued that since the Goths and the Götalanders were the same nation, and the Götalanders were part of the kingdom of Sweden, this meant that the Swedes had defeated the Roman Empire."

 contesting_the_mountain_territories_desc:0 "The mountains breed warfare unlike any other place around us since, even though the terrain might be rough and air might be thin, the will of the lords and kings to fight for power never ceases despite what happens. As we go forth, our people will become addept in mountain tactics and movements in and around hills to the point that we will be able to outdo any enemy that stands in our way."

Few other places have the resource that can make such brilliant red dye and it is because of this rarity and how we use the red dye that others come to see us as a better diplomatic partner. Perhaps red can become the standard royalty?"

 diarchical_administration_desc:0 "Ichma administration is divided into two parts roughly:0 the 'anan (upper) saya ichma' and the 'luran (lower) saya ichma', which represent the upper communities in the highlands and the lower communities closer to the coast. Because the coastal communities are much more vital to the survival of our state, they have traditionally held more sway over government matters, but we must work to continually enforce balanced legislative rules and pass laws that benefit all communities when possible."

They must their valuables and jewels buried with them, at least partly, so that their journey to the afterlife is not a dark and burdensome one. In this way, we honor our recently deceased men and women and bring peace to their body at least in this realm. We only hope that in the next realm, they are as well off as they were here."

It is certainly not out in the open with harsh conditions beating down at us whilst we are the midst of the gods, so the pyramids of our ancestors can do just fine. It will not be only those pyramids though, for we can build more as time goes on in other places where the Ichma people settle down into."

 unite_the_confederacies_of_old_desc:0 "The breakup of the Wari Empire was long ago, but we remember rightly that the Ichma people came about in the ashes of the burning state. Not only us, but many others got their start when the Wari Empire began to burn, leading to several confederacies of people forming afterwards. Some may still be around and some may have been conquered, but we of Ichma must do what we can to reunite the old lands of the Wari Empire."

The shyris is who will lead us to victory in the great struggles we will engage in, and with each one that passes from this life into the next, an elaborate and grand burial ceremony will be held for them.

Their culture and tradtiions might very well be alien to us, but we are not beyond learning to accept them into our fold; our shyris and those around him know the value of accepting these people as they are."
 quitu_cara_cultural_power:0 "Quitu-Cara Culture"
 quitu_cara_cultural_power_desc:0 "Quito is not a political entity with a single 'Quito' culture that extends back for many centuries. Instead, the original Quitu people were conquered some centuries ago by people of the Cara culture, but the conquest did not bring about great death and destruction as one might think. Instead, it brought about a combining of cultures into a product that is greater than its previous individual parts. This Quitu-Cara culture that sprang forth is what we are today and it is what we draw power from in our administration and in our military."

Even when we integrate them inside of our borders, maintaining healthy relationships with the tribal people will be key to keeping the economy of Quito running smoothly."

 integrate_the_others_into_quito_desc:0 "Over time, we are learning to accept and work with people who speak different languages and perform different rituals. Some words blend together over the decades and centuries, some rituals become closer together in how they are performed, and eventually the bond of common kinship is formed as these people join hands with our own. It is these joined hands and through bonds of kinship built up over many ages that Quito will maintain its power both politically and militarily."

Feasts filled with joy and praise to the gods above, games being played by children and adults, instruments being played by our own family members, and good times being had by all within our communities. These are the times we should relish and adore, not just the times of victory via conquest or the success of a good harvest."

Through his work of leading the second revival of Buddhism in Tibetan lands, sponsoring novice monastic people to travel to different lands, and constructing some of the most revered monuments in all of Tibet, we of Guge are well known and have gained a great amount of influence. But, his work was not militarily secured and Guge remained a rather small kingdom despite his grandeur, thus leaving us with merely prestigious structures that survive to now such as the three monasteries."

The form of Buddhism that took root in Tibet changed and morphed over the centuries due to various influences such as shifting borders in the Tarim Basin and ambitions to conquer land whilst also controlling politics at home in the mountainous cities of Lhasa, Dege, Shigatse, and many others. When it looked like the flame of Buddhism in our land was about to be extinguished, it was the rulers of Guge who gave renewed life to the flame, and it is this period of revival that many still know us for."

His work extended far into the realm of Tibetan Buddhism since he is associated with the Shangpa Kagyu, Nyingma, and Sakya schools. Not only this, but he also recognized the first Samding Dorja Phagmo, the highest female incarnation in Tibet and the third highest-ranking persion in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. On top of all of this, he founded the Iron Chain leneage of the Shangpa Kagyu school, thus furthering his work and influence. Truly, Thangtong is a reincarnation of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen."

The Karma Kagyu school, Drikung Kagyu school, Taklung Kagyu school, Shangpa Kagyu school, and the Drukpa Lineage are all children of the Kagyu tradition and with their favor and assistance in both civil and military matters, Tibet will be all the more powerful and unified."
 the_sakya_school:0 "The Sakya School"
 the_sakya_school_desc:0 "The 'pale earth' school comes from the second period of translation of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into the Tibetan language in the late 1000s and was firmly established by the 'Great Sakyapa', Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. The Sakya school has a historical foundation of authority over various people unlike what others might think at first glance since, the Sakya lamas were given authority from the Yuan Dynasty to govern over Tibetan land as a vassal state of sorts. We would do good to utilize the governing capability of the Sakya religious officials as Tibet gains more ground in the world."
 the_gelug_school:0 "The Gelug School"
 the_gelug_school_desc:0 "The foundations of the Gelug school date to the life of Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) and his actions. He founded the Ganden Monastery where the Ganden Tripa is the spiritual leader of the entirey school itself, but the most influential political figure that also holds religious significance has undoubtedly been the Dalai Lama. The Gelug school stresses a variety of matters just as all schools of thought do, but the Gelug school emphasizes vinaya (monastic discipline) more so than others, and it is this disciplined attitude that we will cultivate in our hearts and minds, both in times of peace and in times of war."

We are not averse to fighting like some smaller polities are, for we have been in the midst of fighting for decades now! Fighting to secure our place in Tibet and fighting to have our words become law!"

 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch_desc:0 "We are not patrons of the Gelug school of Vajrayana Buddhism which some find strange. Instead, we support the Karma Kagyu school which is quite different in a number of ways when compared to the Gelug school. Its traditional hierarchs, the Karmapa and Shamarpa, should be great friends of our dynasty instead of having to quarrel with other religious schools; they will know our good will and will be one of the strategic pillars of our rise to power."
 sort_through_muddy_marriages:0 "Profit from Bad Marriages"
 sort_through_muddy_marriages_desc:0 "Marriages can be a... Tough negotiation for some, to put it nicely, and this is very widely pronounced in the royal families of Tibet since a failing marriage or two in a royal family can lead to widespread discontent in places far away from the royal palace. We were ones to capitalize on marriage conflicts in the previous royal family of Tibet, the Phagmodrupa, and we will continue to profit from future bad marriages around us whilst make sure our own marriages are safe and without issue."

 at_the_heart_of_turmoil_desc:0 "There is no shortage of warfare in the heartlands of Tibet. Local lords wanting autonomy, Nepali states struggling against Hindu and Islamic states to the south, Muslim khans to the north threatening our survival, nothing is ever easy up here! If continued war is required to survive in our own land than we will take up arms without hesitation!"
 keep_the_sects_loyal:0 "Keeping the Sects Loyal"
 keep_the_sects_loyal_desc:0 "The Tsangi dynasty must not lose the favor of the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism nor the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism that have sent aid in the past. We should be enforcing more secular authority over these sects when possible, or if this is not possible, then at least be informed about the moves these sects are making so that we can effectively counter them politically or religiously when the time comes."
 put_pretenders_to_rest:0 "Confront Pretenders"
 put_pretenders_to_rest_desc:0 "Some still see us as pretenders to the throne and think that the Phagmodrupa dynasty should be empowered once again, but we simply cannot let this happen. The Tsangi dynasty is in a much better place than the Phagmodrupa dynasty ever was, and if there are any pretenders who wish to install this old dynasty back on the throne, we will gladly meet them in battle or silence them before they can even raise a war banner."
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans:0 "Refuse Local Lords"
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans_desc:0 "The loyalty of local lords is always questionable in Tibet, is it not? Few if any can be truly honest if they are selected by members outside of our administration, meaning we are going to need to overhaul the way we govern as time goes on to better enforce laws that come directly from the Tsangi dynasty. Autonomous lords and authorities that answered to previous people we conquered will be granted no quarter; they will be replaced."

The once great Mali Empire even invaded our lands to claim hegemony over the Akan Gold Trade, but their influence did not last long since we asserted our own independence not long after they came through.

 cavalry_of_the_fulo_desc:0 "To supplement our migrations from the past and to aid our military today, cavalry have been integral to the very nature of the Fulani people. Their useful nature as civilian animals for farmers and such is great, but using them for skirmishing and full on charges against enemy armies in times of war is what we will truly need them for."
 clashes_over_gold:0 "Clashes over Gold"
 clashes_over_gold_desc:0 "The valuable gold mines that the Mali Empire are what helped made it prosper like no other Empire had in West Africa's history. Seizing them as the Mali Empire decays away will line the pockets of Fulani nobles and royals to the point where they, collectively, can field an army like no other in all of West Africa."
 war_over_falling_states:0 "Warring State Chaos"
 war_over_falling_states_desc:0 "The lack of a large Empire in West Africa that can hold power over several areas means that warring states are common. The decaying influence of the Mali Empire has given rise to the state of West Africa that the Fulani have come upon, but they are not going to be swallowed up by the chaos surrounding them. The Fulani will tame the chaos floating about and rein them into a suitable Empire."

 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo_desc:0 "Mali's rulers were Muslim indeed and so are the rulers of eastern states in West Africa, but what of the Fulani leaders? That will be answered at a later date, but none can deny that Muslim influence is increasing over the entire Fulani population. The Muslim influx brings with it more manpower for our military, but it will also bring questions that our administration must answer in time."

 the_influence_of_the_torodbe_desc:0 "They have risen from all parts of those who live in the Western Sudanese region and have been gaining slow influence all throughout the Sahel. The Fulo state is not immune to their influential teachings and several nobles are keen on listening to the words of the Torodbe leaders; they seek to eliminate the remnants of our traditional religion and even encourage jihad against others, but still not every single part of Fulo is on board with them. We cannot expel the Torodbe from our lands it seems, but maybe we can use them for good as times goes on?"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs:0 "Strike down Regional Chiefs"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs_desc:0 "In order to keep order within the wider Fulo state, we will need to deal with tribal ties that are heavily ingrained with local communities.

 great_mosque_of_djenne_desc:0 "Built somewhere between 1200 and 1300 as our tradition tells us, the mosque has slowly become a center of Islamic scholarship and a beacon for traders all around us. Such a symbol of piety is rarely seen in our region and Djenne is truly blessed to have such a great building in our lands.

From July to December, Djenne becomes something of an island and the irrigation of crops around the land becomes possible once more. We rely on this annual flood to help bring us a bit of wealth, but perhaps we can invest more into agricultural techniques that can allow for more to be grown, or different and more valuable crops to be planted."
 adapt_to_changing_trade:0 "Adapting to Evolving Trade"
 adapt_to_changing_trade_desc:0 "With coastal trade from the south and west coming into view, we need to be sure that our importance does not decline. Coastal trade is much easier for people to engage in than trade across plains and savannah so we must be ready for when we get a decrease in merchant numbers. By adapting our merchants and our own way of thinking about trade to this evolution in trade in West Africa, we can still have a fighting chance in the world of trade."
 refined_adobe_architecture:0 "Refine our Adobe Architecture"
 refined_adobe_architecture_desc:0 "Many around us know Djenne for its adobe architecture. The use of mud bricks is well known throughout West Africa and it is a common building material in drier, more arid climates (such as in Djenne) since it is relatively easy to make in large numbers and quite durable in dry conditions. By refining how adobe architecture is done in Djenne, we can reinforce our buildings so that they are stronger and also streamline the process of making mud bricks in general."
 build_upon_our_wealth:0 "Djenne's Wealth"
 build_upon_our_wealth_desc:0 "Prosperity is garnered from knowledge combined with ambition and tempered by commerce, or, at least that is what some of the wealthy merchants in Djenne say. We know that it is true to a degree and we are working to invest the profit we gain from trade and taxation so that our future prospects are much brighter. New trade depots, marvelous yet functional buildings, and prestigious mosques will all be in order for Djenne in time."

There are various royal classes, non-royal nobility, free men of the land, people who work in various castes, and then finally slaves. Along with this, griots are important for telling the ancestral tales and history of Jolof, so they occupt a social class all unto themselves. This hierarchy of social classes must be retained throughout Jolof if it is to be a stable state, with reformations only happening once we are sure we are ready."
 animism_with_islam:0 "Traditions, and Islam"
 animism_with_islam_desc:0 "Islam was brought unto us from the east by people from the Mali Empire but it has not taken root as it has further to the east and north. In Jolof, some of the nobles of our land mix Islam with our native traditions, but still the majority of our people embrace that which is from our traditions. The more we can embrace parts of Islam in conjunction with our own traditional beliefs, the better off we will be as a whole."

Such a position shall be revered throughout Jolof's entirety and never be done away with."
 tributary_kingdom_system:0 "Tributary Kingdoms"
 tributary_kingdom_system_desc:0 "Jolof at its core has been made up of tributary states leading back to a central authority. Jolof historically has been landlocked and the coastal states it presided over paid tribute to the central authority that is Jolof; we should be adjusting this tributary state method of governance as times goes on so we can still exact tribute and funds from our subjects but also govern them in a proper manner."
 elected_head_of_state:0 "Election of the 'Bour ba'"
 elected_head_of_state_desc:0 "The election of the ruler (called the 'Bour ba') is done by a college of electors from the respective tributary states. Those tributary states have their rulers elected from the nobility, and those state rulers come together to elect the ruler of Jolof as a whole. This system of governance has a tendency to be abused by our tributaries, but we can use force if need be to help reform and adjust this system to a more regulated and cogent system."
 balance_out_coastal_trade:0 "Balancing out Coastal Trade"
 balance_out_coastal_trade_desc:0 "Because of developments beyond our control, there is an imbalance in the areas of Jolof. Coastal areas are becoming more wealthy than inland areas due to the rise in international trade and this is having a troubling effect on Jolof itself. To remedy this, we must setup roads and communication networks of some form so that Jolof is less landlocked and more easily able to access the coast from its tributary states. If all goes well, trade potential and wealth distribution will equal out over time."
 an_Empire_unto_jolof:0 "A Future for Ourselves"
 an_Empire_unto_jolof_desc:0 "With administrative matters being sorted and diplomacy through trade being conducted effectively, Jolof must turn to its military so that it can keep up its own strength. Becoming a true Empire requires conquest, proper defense, and most of all, an organized military. By incorporating our tributaries into this military system, Jolof can proclaim a more unified military than other Empires in West Africa's past."

 manage_animist_islamic_relations_desc:0 "Islam and traditional animist beliefs of the Hausa people are intermingling constantly but there is not a true consensus as to what the religion of the Hausa people should be.

 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans_desc:0 "The two head clans of Kaabu are that of the Koring and the Nyancho and they are both very militaristic in nature. They make their money and reputation off of warfare that involves Kaabu and as such help manage most of the Kaabu military. Though the degree of effective military management can vary at times, the military councils they hold and the way in which they take to logistical matters is nothing short of impressive for all of West Africa."
 malian_cavalry_legacy:0 "Malian Military Organization"
 malian_cavalry_legacy_desc:0 "Capitalizing more on how Mali organized its military, cavalry tactics is something that we should naturally focus on since the cavalry culture from the Mali Empire still permeates throughout Kaabu.

Over the decades though, it has evolved into a center of culture and military might that must be defended at any cost. Since Kaabu's inception, we have relied more on offense over defense, but seeing as Kansala is becoming more and more central to our administration and military, and our trade depots are increasingly valued by a number of different groups, we need to properly fortify what we currently hold with walls and garrisons."

 importation_of_musket_weaponry_desc:0 "With trade along our coast increasing as time goes on, the weapons we are getting from trade are becoming more and more useful as time goes on. Though traditional weapons are doing us well, gunpowder weapons are making a large impact on Kaabu's military potential, especially when dealing with less organized tribes inside and outside our domain. Integrating these new weapons fully into our military will undoubtedly bring us victory after victory in the ages to come."

 coming_from_different_war_houses_desc:0 "The founding people of Kong were not from one single dynasty or one single clan or war house, but rather they were from several different war houses.

Their fearsome and powerful legacy is something we strive to uphold."

 indifference_to_kong_religion_desc:0 "When people ask the leaders of Kong, 'What religion do your slaves and workers follow?', they will answer, 'It does not matter. As long as they serve us well, they may worship as they please.'. This mentality has been key in our rise to prominence and will continue to do so since we place more emphasis on money and fighting tactics as opposed to the zealous conversion of our own people."

 establish_mercantile_houses_desc:0 "Whilst the war houses of Kong are plentiful and sometimes a bit hard to control, the increasing flow of trade through our lands means that there should be some system setup so that we can profit in a more systematic manner. Establishing mercantile houses and setting up formal places for merchants to flock to will increase our viability as a trade partner."

The leader of the Funj may retain vague traditions of the past from before they came into an Abrahamic faith, but now that they are well and truly part of one, they must choose whether they are greatly pious or willing to rule with ease.

Him and his men unified the 12 villages (Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba, and Panjuru) into a single loose political entity and helped assimilate people who crossed over into Nupe territory. We will learn from his example and keep his memory alive through stories and art as we go forth into the future."

Thus, we find a great number of settlements at our borders and these people do not speak our language or share many Nupe cultural traits.

 armored_cavalry_warfare_desc:0 "What is different about our cavalry compared to those of the Nupe or the Dahomey is that we choose to use armor for our horses. This helps them survive in battle for longer periods of time and often times it can help turn the tide of battles altogether. Utilizing armor on our swift cavalry into the future will only help us subjugate those who dare stand against us."

Disputes were had and several changes had to be made to our administration and military sectors, but in the end it was all worth it, was it not?

Our heir is chosen by the Oyo Mesi which in it of itself is a council comprised of seven prinipal figures. This council is an electoral one at that and is led by the Bashorun (essentially the Prime Minister) and each of the seven position in the Oyo Mesi represent the various interests of the Oyo Empire itself.

After this, a slow fusion of two clans happened, this being between the Kayi Clan and Ngizimis Kanembu Clan, and the result was the political entity of Yao.

They came back and struck a blow against us so hard it almost made the entirety of Yao collapse in on itself, but we managed to hold ourselves firm despite this devasation. That moment in time taught our people that facing death in a war is something that will be frequent for Yao, and we will still fight with all we got no matter how close to death we are."

Despite what it struggled with, Nahan flourished over time and imparted onto us a legacy of local conquest in these mountains and highlands around us. These harsh lands are ruthless in terms of political movements as it is, so we would be wise to keep in mind the warlike mentality of our ancestors."

Sometimes Sirmur even sees subjugation by others, but we must not see this subjugation as a pure loss in competence for us. It is rather an opportunity for Sirmur to grow even more, just in a different direction! Sending aid to an overlord and observers to learn how they conquer, move in battle, and conduct administrative practices is exactly what Sirmur should be doing."

Sirmur has plenty of farming potential, we just need the funding and the tools to get the ground ready and the people settled in place. Now that Sirmur is getting on its feet in both previously mentioned aspects, we can start to focus on the agricultural sector and improve our overall grain stores."

Our proximity to the homeland of the Punjabi people and the epicenter of the Sikh faith means that sometimes we do get refugees of Sikh affiliation, meaning we need to contend with some serious religious differences in our own land. Sirmur is by no means in a state ready to stoke religious tensions, so we will be striving for mutual understanding with the Sikh people in our own land."

 chains_of_sirmur_command_desc:0 "Sirmur has traditionally been a somewhat decentralized state due to the mountains we find our heart of power inside of, but developments over the past few generations has led to our power increasing, our revenue growing, and our knowledge of administrative practices increasing.

Whether it is a raja, maharaja, emir, or sultan at the head of the Sirmur state, the loyalty to them must be ensured so that defenses are not compromised and the state itself is growing instead of shrinking. Slowly replacing these noble fiefs with people more loyal to the administration (such as members of the royal family) will be the next step to improving our state as a whole."

And yet, it is this weapon that our military use regularly for hand-to-hand combat (alongside any martial arts that are known to them) with devastating success. Especially in the tight mountain passes where armies may encounter each other more suddenly, the kukri has become a tool that both experienced and new soldiers trust to get them through close quarters combat. Going forth, having it be a standard training weapon will serve to instill a great degree of strength in our soldiers."

From being at first in Bajinath to then going to Champawat later on, the transitions have been gradual but significant enough for our people to remember them to this very day because moving such supplies and resources to a new location is pivotal. If we can channel this will again in the future for new building projects and when we need to perhaps relocate some signficant structures, we will be able to take serious advantage of the terrain inside our borders."

As things progressed, Doti and Kumaon remained as the only two serious forces that could live up to the legacy of the past and it is this claim to the old throne of the Katyuri Dynasty that we are known for. There is respect to be had for living within the bounds of this legacy, that much is certain."

 surpass_kuamon_in_importance_desc:0 "Whilst we respect Kumaon to a degree in regards to politics and diplomacy, we cannot stand by and let them continue to usurp the power that rightfully belongs to Doti instead. The rulers of Kumaon have proven time and again that they cannot handle the chains of power effectively and that their subjects run wild without proper orders. Soon enough we will have our chance at showing Kumaon and others just how much we can live up the legacy of the Katyuri Dynasty, we just have to bide our time."

 usage_of_the_kali_and_karnali_rivers_desc:0 "The name 'Doti' stems from the older term 'doab' which generally means the land between two rivers.

Whilst we of Jumla are far from being true Rajput warriors and nobles, we can emulate some of their martial prowess by emphasizing stricter training methods and a more well educated set of commanders.

There are still some around to this day, Jumla being one of them, but that collapse into decentralized unrest and disorder instilled harsh lessons into the ruling family of Jumla.

Jumla needs the ruler to be ready and able to lead from the front with the men of the army! It is dangerous, true, but it is also inspiring to see that the one who rules Jumla is ready and willing to suffer the ravages of battle alongside a mere recruit or officer."

 learning_flexibility_in_combat_desc:0 "In Jumla's experience, fighting in the high elevations of our home has been harrowing and rough over the generations, but it has taught each generation many things that may or may not carry over to the next generation. Now that writing and printing are becoming more of a realiy all around us, it is time that we make those teachings from past generations put into solid manuscripts and tomes ready for future generations to learn from and critique.

Yet the Tharu people have been seemingly gifted with an inherent gift:0 resistance to malaria!

Thus, we are and have been seen as people of the forest for a great many generations now, practicing farming, hunting, and gathering to a much greater degree than our mountainous cousins.

Though much has changed since the time of the Licchavis (such as their architecture being destroyed by earthquakes), we find ourselves still in need of these barracks at the edge of our city to provide us with a sense of security and militancy.

This marriage from back then helped bring Tibetan Buddhism into our region of the Himalayas, promoting religious dialogue and the diffusion of cultural and religious traditions throughout all regions nearby Kathmandu. Perhaps it is time we reach out to the Tibetan people? Perhaps it is time that Kathmandu becomes another trade hub and center of diffusion of cultural ideas."

These experiences have hardened those Kathmandu and made its inhabitants ready for whatever nature may through at it; you can knock its people down to the ground, but you will never keep them down."

The former take care of fishing, the latter take care of farming, yet both seem to have consistent feuds that make Sambas a rather volatile state at times.

Though Kaharingan is seen as a form of Hinduism by outsiders, to us it is a very core part of the people of Sambas as a whole; Islam's influence across those who follow Kaharingan is noticeable in that it is melding with these traditions in a variety of ways.
